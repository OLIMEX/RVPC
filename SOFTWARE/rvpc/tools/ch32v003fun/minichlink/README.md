# minichlink

A free, open mechanism to use the CH-LinkE $4 programming dongle for the CH32V003.

If on Linux, be sure to type make sure to install the `99-WCH-LinkE.rules` build rule to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`

On Windows, if you need to you can install the WinUSB driver over the WCH interface 1.

The exe here is about 12kB and contains everything except for the libusb driver.  In Linux you need `libusb-1.0-dev`.
