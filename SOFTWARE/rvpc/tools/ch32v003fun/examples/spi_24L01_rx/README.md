## nRF24L01(+) library
This is the doing of [Reza Ebrahimi](https://github.com/ebrezadev), I've just included a copy of [his library](https://github.com/ebrezadev/nRF24L01-C-Driver) here and made some modifications.

## Arduino friend
If, like me, you only have the one ch32v003 evaluation board, you can find a [friend for it here](https://github.com/recallmenot/ch32v003fun_friends/tree/main/Arduino/NRF24L01_TX).
