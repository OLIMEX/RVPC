# Demonstration of PWM using Timer 1
This example shows how to set up Timer 1 (the Advanced Control Timer) to generate
Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) on two output pins. PWM is frequently used to do
variable brightness on LEDs or for digital-to-analog conversion when combined with
a suitable lowpass filter.

## Use
Connect GPIO pins PD0 and PC4 to LEDs (with appropriate current limiting) and
observe that they fade with different cycles.
