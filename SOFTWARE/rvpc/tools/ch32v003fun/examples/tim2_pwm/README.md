# Demonstration of PWM using Timer 2
This example shows how to set up Timer 2 (the General Purpose Timer) to generate Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) on two output pins.
PWM is frequently used to do variable brightness on LEDs or for digital-to-analog conversion when combined with a suitable lowpass filter.

## Use
Connect GPIO pins PD04 and PD3 to LEDs (with appropriate current limiting) and observe that they fade at the same speed, but phase-rotatd by 180Â°.
